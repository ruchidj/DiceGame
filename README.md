# "Roll & Run"

### (WP-Project 1)

<p>This is a game where a user rolls a virtual dice to determine how 
    many spaces to move, a.k.a "run" forward. <br>
    The point of the game is to finish with as little total points as possible.<br>
    Each move is one point. Unless the user finishes level one in under 30 moves. 
    Then they go to level two and start over, with each move only counting as half of a point.<br>
    If you make it to level 3, each move is only worth a third of a point!<br>
    Try to finish with as little points as possible!
